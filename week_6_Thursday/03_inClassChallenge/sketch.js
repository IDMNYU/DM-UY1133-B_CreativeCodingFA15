/*

Using the text from Alice in Wonderland or your own
manipulate the text using various string methods.

See: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp
See: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp

- slice()
- substring()
- substr()
- replace()
- concat()
- charAt()

Ideally, focus on just a few lines of text to manipulate. 
The goal is to understand how to manipulate strings, less on how
to graphically show those manipulations
