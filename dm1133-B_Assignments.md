## Project 1: Adjective

Pick an adjective and make a program that illustrates that adjective interactively. You may not use images.  Only drawing functions, meaning mostly stuff found in the ‘graphics’ section.
The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be using only lines, shapes, colors?

Code must be 100 lines or more, not including spacing, comments or commented out code

Ingredients: Graphics (shape, color, line, placement, custome shapes), Control Structures (if, for, while), Movement, Interaction (mouse, keyboard), Custom functions, Random.

Weekly pushes to your GitHub Repo are required


# Project 2: Choice 

Option 1- Persuasion: Choose a current event, news item, or issue that you feel strongly about and make a piece that addressees it.  Think of it as an interactive, algorithmic documentary.    The emphasis of this project is using code to be persuasive.  How can you convey a point of view in using procedural generation and interactivity?

Ingredients: Control structures, interaction, OOP, API's, addon’s, libraries, advance topics


Option 2 - High Score: Design and program a game. This project focuses on motion and interaction. To place the focus on those two components exclusively, the visual elements will be minimal. The visual components of the game are restricted to ~6 basic shapes on the screen at a time, but you may use any motion or interaction technique that you can imagine. You many use only lines, circles, and rectangles, but you may also use simple typography to keep score or show other basic data. These restrictions have been defined to minimize the complexity of the project, to encourage you to be creative within constraints, and to place the emphasis on the qualities of the interaction. After you have completed the game as geometry, you may choose to “skin” the game.

Ingredients: Control structures, interaction, OOP, API's, addon’s, libraries, advance topics


Option 3 - Interactive Narrative: Using a pre-existing narrative, or create your own, create an interactive narrative. Remember, that choice is paramount with interactivity. As a result, your story should have multiple paths to explore. This can be literal or it can be abstract. Experiment with time!

Ingredients: graphics, interactivity, image, video, sound, text, time structures, change, OOP


Option 4 - Choose your own adventure: Come up with your own idea, and describe it to us. Bring in examples, assests, and references of various Artists, Designers, Programmers, Games, Firms, Projects, etc. We do not exist in a vacuum.
