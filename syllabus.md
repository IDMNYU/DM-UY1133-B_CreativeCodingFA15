## Creative Coding: An Intro to Creative Coding
This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no programming experience, who are interested in creating interactivity.  Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result.  In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking - to think concurrently and modularly.  By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for creating interactivity including: event-driven creative applications, interactive installations,  graphical user interfaces, networked video games and user interfaces.  Interactivity will be introduced and discussed throughout.

# Program Goals

This course reinforces the IDM Program goals by

• Integrate multiple mediums of image, text, sound, physical, space, and interactivity. (Reinforced)

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition. 

• Combine research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration. (Reinforced)

• Collaborate across disciplines.

• Adopt and use professional practices. (Reinforced)

• Integrate Cultural Literacy

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition.

### Assessment

Assessment will occur by reviewing weekly coding assignments & challenges, project milestones, and final projects. The course is cumulative.  Please see the Grading Section for specific grade breakdown, calendar for due dates, and assignments for briefs. 

Students will evaluate their own progressed in a course in two ways: 1) A course evaluation form, which will be developed based on the course’s individual objectives. 2) Students will participate in a self reflection assignment due Week 7 (Oct 20) & Week 14  (Dec 8) or as otherwise noted. This written evaluation is worth 15 points and to be turned into me as a separate document.

• Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result. 

• Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.

• Compare and contrast OOP versus Procedural Programming

### Course Requirements

• Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many, etc) ONLY

• Talk to me in person about issues or problems

• Consult the github account for the class at least once a week for up to date information 

• Come to class on time and be familiar with the current class topics, and be ready to answer or ask questions and participate in discussions

• Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave

• Be professional at all times in your communication and attitude

• Complete all assignments by due date

• Acquire and keep up with all of the readings. Read all assigned readings before class.

• Devote at a minimum 8 to 12 hours a week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, readings and studying concepts covered in class.

• Have Desire amounting to Enthusiasm (to learn and to explore)

• Have Patience, Persistence, and Discipline

• Be Creative

• Pay attention to Detail & Craft

• Have Self-confidence and Pride in your work

• Take Risks & be Fearless in your assignments

• Don’t be afraid to fail. Don’t let your failures determine you. Rise again.

### Attendance
Unexcused absences (without a note from a doctor or agency) will affect your grade. Attendance is taken at the beginning of class

• One unexcused absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 points out of 100 for each additional absence.

• 5 unexcused absences is grounds for dismissal from the course.

• All presentation and critique days are mandatory.  Being absent on critique days, affects your grade for that project as well as your participation grade. Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not. Critiques can not be made up.

• Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (Email is preferred) Demonstrate time management, communication and respect.

• Be on time! Lateness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes you are late, your participation grade drops.

• Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.

### Contacting Me
Email is the preferred initial contact (katherine.bennett@nyu.edu). Email is suitable for short questions (to answers that cannot be found in the syllabus), to set up appointments, or to notify me about being late or absent. Emails should not be longer than 5 sentences.

For matters longer than 5 sentences, please email me to make an appointment during office hours. This is the proper way to address longer questions, issues, to ask me about an assignment, review a grade you received, or to discuss other matters. If you send me a long email, I am simply going to respond by asking you to meet with me to resolve the matter. I will not resolve matters over email.

If I have asked you to schedule an appointment with me, I am not trying to avoid you. I am offering you my full attention and preparation. Due to my schedule and other campus responsibilities, I ask you to respond to emails and to be respectful of time.

### Course Structure

This is a hybrid course - both lecture and studio. Students will work on individual projects and group collaborations. Work will be completed both inside and outside of the class. Class will be a mix of lectures, class discussion, Show & Tell, workshops/challenges, studio time and critiques. Guest critics may be present.

The course can be broken down into 3 sections throughout the semester: programming basics, Object Orientated Programming (OOP), and advance topics (automation/behaviors, using addons - JSON, API’s, Arduino, Computer Vision, Sound, etc).

A typical week will aim for the following schedule:

	• Day 1: 12:30 - 1:50 Demo/Lecture/Workshop/Discussion
	• Day 1: 1:50 - 2:00 Show & Tell Presentations
	• Day 1: 2:00 - 2:20 Tickets to Leave
	• Day 2: 12:30 - 1:00 Review + Questions
	• Day 2: 1:00 - 2:10 Pair Programming Challenge
	• Day 2: 2:10 - 2:20 Submit Pair Programming Challenge Progress + determine next steps

	Please note, until Thanksgiving Holiday, Day 1 is on Thursdays. Beginning December 1st, Day 1 is on Tuesdays. Make sure to understand what date your Show + Tell presentation is!!

###Important Aspects of this Course

Pair programming is a popular way to learn and to work on projects. Two people share one computer and write code together. For the second half of class, an exercise will be given which will be worked on in pairs. The exercise will be due at the end of the class period and presented to class. On occasions the deadline will be at another point. Yet, the exercise is meant to be worked on together - on one laptop, in one program. 

Homework projects will be turned in via GitHub. GitHub is a web hosting service that supports Git version control. It is more important than your resume, whether you are an artist or designer. It’s used largerly for software, but can be used for anything. It’s important to become familar with it, develop good habits (it’s like Time Machine, but better). See the assigned reading links for more information.

Time. Time management is everything. You will need it to have reasonable accomplishments in this class. The material is cumulative. The readings are essential. Writing code is the only way to make progress and to fully synthesize the material. It becomes evident quite quickly. Develop excellent time management. You will need 8-15 hours outside of class to succeed.  
Projects are not always group projects.

Using code found elsewhere. It's super easy to find code online. As tempting as this is, I am going to ask that you write your own code for the first 2/3 of the semester. This will help you grasp and retain the fundamentals. It does help to write the code from the book out, line by line. But, this cannot be submitted as a homework assignment, project or pair programming challenge. I am looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as cheating.

#### How to Submit Assignments via GitHub


Do the follow these steps for each assignment:

1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking].
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.

###[Show and Tell](dm1133-B_ShowAndTell.md)

You will be assigned a [Show and Tell presentation date here](dm1133-B_ShowAndTell.md).  Please research the assigned artist/designers/firms/pieces/collectives in advance. Each presentation will be about 10-15 minutes long. Be able to address the following, along with *3-4 visual examples of each individual or team's work*: (2 points each)

• What is original/unique about how this artist uses technology? 

• What kind of code did the artist use?  (JavaScript? Flash? Procesing? openFrameworks?) How are they using the code? What is the code achieving?

• Why is it necessary that the artist use code?  (ie: particularly if it’s non-interactive, could it have been achieved with traditional or linear media?)

• Your presentation must be prepared and professional. DO NOT READ OFF YOUR SLIDES. Show the work. Discuss the work.


### Grading


• Show & Tells			3%

• Self-Assessments (Tickets to Leave, Midterm & Final)		7%

• Participation 		5%

• In-class challenges   10%

• Exercises	            25%

• Project 1: Adjective (critiqued)		20%

• Project 2: Choice (critiqued)			30%

Each assignment will be allotted a certain number of points. For example, Show & Tell presentations are worth 8 points, 2 points for each required aspect. The points are given based on those aspects, and also how thorough and crafted those aspects are presented. If you receive 8 points, you have an 8/8 or a 100% for your Show and Tell grade which is worth 3% of your final grade. If you receive 6/8, you have a 75% for your Show & Tell grade. If you have a 3/8, you have a 37.5% for your Show & Tell grade. If you do not do your Show & Tell or fail, you get a 0%.

For each project your grade will be assessed upon the following: Principles, Creativity/Thoughtfulness, Craft. Below gives you a sense of the spectrum, giving examples for high, middle and low grades.

#### Principles:

• Superior - A - Your work shows evidence and understanding of programming concepts discussed in readings, lectures, and exercises, as you bend them to your will.

• Satisifactory - C - Your work shows evidence of concepts and is still developing an understanding of course material. You understand some aspects, but aren’t utilizing them fully. Usage is cursory. Keep pushing your work and review the material to revisit how you can integrate it to your work.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work shows some evidence of concepts discussed, but lacks key understanding, confidence, robustness and authority. Aspects are lacking. Reviewing course material is required. Ask questions in class. Manage your time better.


#### Creativity, Thoughtfulness:

• Superior - A - YYour work demonstrates your personality and a great depth of engagement with the material. It’s extremely evident that you are thinking, exploring, playing and taking risks. You are creating wonderful experiences.

• Satisifactory - C - You are executing your ideas, but more time is needed to consider more deeply about what is conceptually and physically happening. They are barely getting off the ground. Or have large bits that are broken. Do more research and exploring. Play.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work is so straightforward that it’s flat. It’s barely coded (or badly broken). It’s copied from elsewhere and not expanded upon. Question and Iterate your work to push your it further. Read. Play. Get off the lame track and get inspired.



#### Craft:

• Superior - A - Your work shows delicate care and consideration to presentation and professionalism. You code is neat, clean, commented and structured. Your friends consider you “Type A.” Your style is evident.

• Satisifactory - C - Your work shows the birth of your ideas, but further time and iteration can really push your work to excel. Your code is there, but messy. It can be simplified and made cleaner. What you put into it, is what you get out of it. Practice makes perfect!

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work is rushed and looks like it was done on your train-ride in or the night before. Make your work something you are proud of. You are here to build your portfolio after all, aren’t you?


### Participation will be based upon: Professionalism, Engagement, and Improvement


#### Professionalism:

• Superior - A - Always arrives on time; assignments turned in properly and on time; respectful of others in class and gives feedback appropriately.

• Satisifactory - C - Usually arrives on time; most assignments turned in on time; listens to others.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Often tardy; turns in assignments late; fails to prepare for class; in attentive to instructor or other students



#### Engagement:

• Superior - A - Always contributes appropriately to class discussion; frequently offers to demonstrate technique; shows leadership in group projects.

• Satisifactory - C - Usually contributes to class discussion; has demonstrated technique; participates actively in group projects.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Does not participate in class discussion; no evidence of technique; fails to contribute adequately to group projects. 



#### Improvement:

• Superior - A - Shows an exceptional and growing understanding of technique; builds on previous lessons; accepts critique and makes proper adjustments.

• Satisifactory - C - Technique is developing; has shown some ability to build on previous lessons; generally able to accept critique.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Little or no development of technique; is unable or unwilling to accept critique; unable to make adjustments.




#### The numerical breakdown for letter grades is as follows:

• A	100-90		Excellent

• B	89-80		Very Good/Good

• C	79-70		Satisfactory

• D	69-63		Poor; Below Average

• F	63 & below	Unacceptable

### Technology in the Classroom

Please respect class time and the contact with me, your professor. When I say laptops down, I expect laptops to be closed and your attention focused on the presentation and class discussion. Utilize your phones only on break. Keep  your phones on silent otherwise. If you absolutely need to take a call, please excuse yourself from class.The quality of the class depends in large part on the quality of your attention and active participation. In particular, give me and your fellow students the respect deserved. Give your full attention when students are presenting work and while I am going through lectures and demos. Continued use of cell phones or social networking sites during class time are a distraction. Students that are not respectful of class time will be asked to leave class. Course material missed is their own responsibility to cover, make-up and address. It is not the Professor’s.



### Academic Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/code-of-conduct/academic-dishonesty" target="_blank">NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy</a> in its entirety.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

This includes copying code for other sources, using code from other sources with only slight modifications and using code from other sources without a reference.


###  Educational Accessibility Statement

NYU-Polytechnic is committed to assuring equal educational opportunity and full participation for all students.
