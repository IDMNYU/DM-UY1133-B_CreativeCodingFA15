/*

Finish transitioning the previous script where we created different functions,
to methods for the class. Then, by passing different parameters to the class constuctor
and the methods, make each object/instance of the object, be unique from the others.
Make at least 5 different monsters.
Take it further: use an array to store them, get some of them to move on input, etc.

THEN:
Take one of your former sketches (Exercise 1 is a good one) and translate it into classes.
Make multiple and different monsters. Add functionality to them (and your code!)
